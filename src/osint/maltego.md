Once all the above is done, select the option “Open a blank graph” and finish the process. 
This will allow you to visualize a screen similar to the one presented below:

The next thing we should do to perform our first search would be to go to the “Transforms” tab and “Transform Hub”.
This will display the catalog of Transform Tools that can be installed in Maltego

Once you have installed all the Transfer Tools, go back to the blank tab we created earlier and in the “Entity Palette” select “Domain” (you can use the search bar located in the same section), and drag it to the screen, as you can see in the following gif:
(In this example, we will make a scan of the site “paterva.com”, since they are the creators of Maltego and have given their permission to carry out this kind of scan).

Once you’re done with it, right-click on the entity, and click on the arrow next to “All transforms”, this will start the scan.

Once the scan is complete, you should obtain a graph similar to the one below, displaying all the information obtained by Maltego during the scan.
